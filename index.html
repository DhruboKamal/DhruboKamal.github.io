<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="post">
    Hi, I am Mahdee Mushfique Kamal. I'm in my Senior year of BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). 
    I am also part-time Junior Data Engineer at <a href="https://concured.com/"> Concured </a>
</br>
    My career goal is to work as a software engineer in the industry and eventually go to graduate school to pursue a PhD for getting a role as an industry researcher. I haven't decided what I want to specialize in. But I have a deep interest in Graph Theory, Machine Learning and Bioinformatics.
</br>    
    I am a passionate competitive debater. I have participated in over 30 national and international tournaments and served BUET Debating Club as General Secretary.
