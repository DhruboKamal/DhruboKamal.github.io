    About Me

Hi, I am Mahdee Mushfique Kamal. I am a sophomore pursuing a BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). As a kid I always wanted to have a computer in our home to play games. I had to wait almost half a decade to have one in our home. After a few months of having the computer, I was introduced to C programming by accident, which caught my attention because of my interest in mathematics. So, I decided that I want to study in CSE. I had to go through a very competitive examination to secure my admission at CSE,BUET. I solve Codeforces problems for fun. Also, over the years I came across many interesting concepts and clever solutions through my venture for knowledge and my love for CS grew.

My career goal is to work as a software developer in the industry and eventually go to graduate school to pursue a PhD. I haven't decided what I want to specialize in. But I have a deep interest in distributed systems, machine learning and bioinformatics.

I have attended and had some success in Math Olympiad and NHSPC at the collegiate level. I am a passionate competitive debater. I have participated in over 30 national and international tournaments and served BUET Debating Club as publication Secretary.

In his free time, I read books, watch travel vlogs on youtube and play violin.
