<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="post">
    Hi, I am Mahdee Mushfique Kamal, a recent graduate with a BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from
    Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I work remotely as a Software Engineer at ELELEM
    Artificial Intelligence Ltd, where I design and implement large-scale AI-powered systems. Previously, I served as a
    Junior Data Engineer at Concured Ltd, contributing to data-driven solutions and backend systems.
    <br>
    I aim to excel as a software engineer in the industry, with plans to pursue a PhD and transition into an industry
    researcher role. My interests lie in Graph Theory, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering, and I am eager
    to explore their intersections in future research.
    <br>
    In addition to my technical endeavors, I am a passionate competitive debater and have participated in over 30
    national and international tournaments. I am also proud to have won the DU-IIT HackTheVerse Hackathon and secured
    1st Runner-Up at the IEEE International Signal Processing Cup 2023. I have served as the General Secretary of BUET
    Debating Club, leading and organizing key
    events while contributing to the club's growth.
