<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="post">
    Hi, I am Mahdee Mushfique Kamal. I am a sophomore pursuing a BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I was introduced to C programming unanticipatedly when I was in class 9. Computer programming caught my attention because of my interest in mathematics. So, I decided to major in CSE. I had to go through a very competitive examination to secure my admission at CSE,BUET. Over the years, I have come across many interesting concepts and solutions which makes me more passionate about CS. 
</br>
    My career goal is to work as a software engineer in the industry and eventually go to graduate school to pursue a PhD. I haven't decided what I want to specialize in. But I have a deep interest in distributed systems, machine learning and bioinformatics.
</br>    
    I have attended and had some success in Math Olympiad and NHSPC at the collegiate level. I am a passionate competitive debater. I have participated in over 30 national and international tournaments and served BUET Debating Club as publication Secretary. In his free time, I read books, watch travel vlogs on youtube and play violin.
