    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="post">
        I am currently pursuing my BSc (Engineering) degree in CSE from BUET . I crave to have a career in the research or software industry where I can build things ( websites, applications, solutions) that others can use and get benefited from.To reach that benchmark, I am developing myself by learning new things, implementing it through coding and using it to solve real life problems.
    </br>
        I have a decent problem solving ability which came from a love towards mathematics and also trying to enhance this ability with the help of competitive programming.
    </br>
        I am a passionate debater, which helped me to learn ‘a little’ from a wide range of topics, to collaborate with others by sharing ideas and infos while debating and also to be confident about my presentation and leadership skills.
