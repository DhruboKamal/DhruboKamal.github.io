As you prepare for the Quantitative Reasoning measure of the GREÂ® General Test, we want you to be aware of another free resource that may be helpful to you. Using instructional videos, the [Khan Academy website](https://www.khanacademy.org/) provides additional explanations of concepts in the [Math Review for the Quantitative Reasoning Measure of the GRE General Test (PDF)](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_math_review.pdf).
